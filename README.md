# Heart Failure Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the occurrence of heart disease based on various patient attributes using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop accurate models that can assist in early detection and preventive measures for cardiovascular diseases.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 11 features including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, electrocardiogram results, and other relevant attributes. The target variable is a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset. This included:

- Analyzing feature distributions and identifying potential correlations with the target variable.
- Visualizing data using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
- Handling missing values and outliers.

## Feature Engineering

Based on the EDA findings, relevant feature transformations and encoding techniques were applied to prepare the data for modeling. This involved:

- One-hot encoding for categorical features.
- Scaling and normalization of numerical features.
- Feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques (if necessary).

## Machine Learning Models

Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated for heart disease prediction, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Model Evaluation and Selection

The performance of each model was assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Cross-validation techniques were employed to estimate the generalization performance of the models.

After thorough evaluation, the top-performing models were identified, and their strengths and limitations were analyzed.

## Technologies and Libraries

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model development, and model evaluation for a binary classification problem in the healthcare domain. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to the early detection and prevention of heart disease, potentially improving patient outcomes.
